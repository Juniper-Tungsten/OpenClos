# Deployment mode
# ztpStaged: true/false, true indicates ZTP process goes through 2-stage
# device configuration. During leaf device boot-strap, it gets generic config,
# then OpenClos finds the topology and applies new topology.
# False indicates all leaf configs are generated based on cabling-plan and 
# deployed to the device using ZTP process. 
# ztpStagedAttempt: How many times OpenClos tries to connect to leaf
# to collect lldp data when it receives trap from that leaf. 
# default is 5 times. 0 means no-op so it basically disables the 2-stage.
# ztpStagedInterval: How long OpenClos waits in between retries. 
# default is 60 seconds. 0 means do not wait. 
# ztpVcpLldpDelay: How long OpenClos waits between delete VCP on EX4300 and LLDP collection
# ztpStagedAttempt and ztpStagedInterval only take effect
# when ztpStaged is set to true.
